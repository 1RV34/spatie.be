<h3 class="title">Where you'd end up</h3>

<p>
    We are a compact but powerful team of (currently) 11 of web developers based in Antwerp.
    We'd made quite a name with our open source work in the Laravel ecosystem and recently started building more and more tools for developers.
    We share a lot of what we learn: be it in ebooks &amp; courses, videos or in-house knowledge sharing sessions.
</p>

<p>
    A few examples of what we're up to:
</p>

<ul class="bullets bullets-green">

    <li><span class="icon">{{ svg('icons/far-angle-right') }}</span> Courses we made, like Laravel Beyond CRUD, Laravel Packagre Training, Front Line PHP and Event Sourcing in Laravel
    </li>
    <li><span class="icon">{{ svg('icons/far-angle-right') }}</span> Applications for international names like Tomorrowland, Krauthammer or Martin Garrix</li>

</ul>

<p>You'll have a say in what you'll be working on. No really, we Ã¡re listening. If you're curious to see how we work, these public <a href="https://guidelines.spatie.be">guidelines</a> could give you a first impression.</p>

<p>
    We don't take on just any new project but only those where you and the entire team can learn something new. We always work with the latest versions of software so you can keep your knowledge up to date, and make use of the newest features.
