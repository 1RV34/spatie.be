                                    Spend <strong>half a day each week</strong> on experiments and open source work.</li>

                                    <strong>Juggle with work-life balance</strong> in our little circus after that umpteenth quarantine. We don't do overtime.

                                    <strong>Regularly working from home</strong> has become an efficient routine. 
                                    Yet we value personal connections and visit the office at least two days a week. We get that those who have to commute have a different regime than someone who only has to jump on a bike.
