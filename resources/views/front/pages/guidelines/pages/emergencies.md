Things in production are not always working as they should be. In general, try to keep a cool head. A correct fix is better than a quick, and potentially wrong one.

When you are working on fixing an emergency in production these tips might help:

- ask a colleague to code review any changes, big and small, that you might make
- only perform the minimal code changes to fix the problem at hand. Don't make any unrelated changes or performance improvements
